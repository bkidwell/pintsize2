# Pintsize

Next generation Pintsize!

**project members** write your wishes in Issues or Wiki pages. Go nuts!

Project status: **just getting started**; not runnable yet.

## Plan

**Pintsize** is an application for collecting votes on the currently playing track on any Internet radio station running Icecast.

* An IRC bot logs into the configured IRC channels.
* Announces new artist and title whenever the track changes on the IceCast stream.
* Accepts votes for the current track via IRC messages.
