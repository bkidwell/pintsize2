# Pintsize

# This project has been moved to BitBucket. This repository here is only an archive.

I can't find a GUI for Git that's FOSS and works on a Linux desktop and satisfies my needs; TortoiseHg, using the Mercurial repository format, makes me happy. So I've moved this project to https://bitbucket.org/bkidwell/pintsize .

Next generation Pintsize!

Project status: **just getting started**; not runnable yet.

## Plan

**Pintsize** is an application for collecting votes on the currently playing track on any Internet radio station running Icecast.

* An IRC bot logs into the configured IRC channels.
* Announces new artist and title whenever the track changes on the IceCast stream.
* Accepts votes for the current track via IRC messages.
